getTogether (Social Planner App Pitch):

It can often be difficult to plan social events and gatherings. While social media apps and sites such as Facebook allows for its users to invite their friends and colleagues to events, there is a way to expand on this idea by offering certain features to help users plan their nights. Our app would be encompass all areas of event planning. We would allow users to authenticate and connect to their Facebook accounts to give an easy way to invite friends to their events that they plan. Using a GPS API such as Google Maps or a similar service, users can receive detailed information about how close guests are to arriving or local events that they can begin to base their nights around. If the users would like to begin their night at a restaurant of their choice and end their night at a bowling alley nearby, the app would give recommendations based on the users input. Along with this there would be a connection to multiple API's to help search for nearby events, show reviews and feedback about certain places or schedule reservations through popular application API's such as SeatGeek, Yelp, OpenTable, Resy, etc. The idea of expanding on event planning through a do-it-all web application is one that would take advantage of the endless services that already gather data about local activites and streamline this information so users can efficiently plan their gatherings with our web apps assistance.
